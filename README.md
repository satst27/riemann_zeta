# riemann_zeta
The three files show the calculation of Riemann zeta, Lerch and Dirichlet L-functions based on the use of the Double Expoential quadrature 
rule around the saddle points. This leads to highly accurate formulas that can produce thousands of digits of precision in a resonable time. Memory requirements are minimal.
